# YoutubeDownloader
This program uses DearPyGUI and pyTube libraries to offer a simple, efficient GUI that allows users to download Youtube videos. 

Copy the link to your desired video, paste it in the application text bar, and choose which download option you'd prefer. 

*NOTE*
At the moment, this application only allows users to download videos in 720p. Alternatively, they can download just the audio. 
The application does not allow users to download the following, either: Age-restricted content, Members-only content, and Private content.

Use at your own risk.
