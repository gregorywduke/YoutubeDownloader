# YoutubeDownloader
This program uses DearPyGUI and pyTube libraries to offer a simple, efficient GUI that allows users to download Youtube videos. 

** NOTE **
YoutubeDownloader is currently non-fuctional as the pytube library is now out of date. This program will NOT process any requests successfully until the pytube library, which this program depends on, is updated. 

Copy the link to your desired video, paste it in the application text bar, and choose which download option you'd prefer. 

** NOTE **
At the moment, this application only allows users to download videos in 720p. Alternatively, they can download just the audio. 
The application does not allow users to download the following, either: Age-restricted content, Members-only content, and Private content.

Use at your own risk.
